// Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

// Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable. For example, instead of writing the same line 10 times to print some text, you can use a loop to repeat it for you.

// Rust has three types of loops: loop, while, and for.

// Types :-->>
// loop
// while loop
// for loop

//..........loop

fn main (){
    
loop {
  println!("This will repeat forever!");
}
}

//dont run if your pc is slow. (its runs forever until you press ctrl + C)
