# Rust Practice Repository
<br>

Welcome! 👋  
<br>
This repository is dedicated to my **Rust learning journey** — starting from the very basics (*Hello, World!*) to **advanced level projects**.  
<br>
 📌 Goals<br>
- Learn Rust syntax and core concepts
<br>- Practice ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
<br>- Explore collections, error handling, and concurrency
<br>- Work on real-world mini projects
<br>- Build advanced projects to gain production-level experience
<br>
## 🚀 Progress Tracking
<br>I’ll organize my practice as follows:
<br>1. **Beginner** – Hello World, variables, functions, control flow
<br>2. **Intermediate** – Structs, enums, error handling, modules
<br>3. **Advanced** – Traits, generics, lifetimes, async, multithreading
<br>4. **Projects** – CLI tools, web servers, system-level applications

<br> 🛠️ Tools
<br>- Rust (latest stable version)
<br>- Cargo (Rust’s package manager and build tool)
<br>- VS Code / IntelliJ Rust plugin

---<br>

<br>💡 This repository will grow as I improve my Rust skills step by step.  
Stay tuned for updates! 🔥.
